# Pig Latin Translator
This is a pig latin translator that will take in an english sentence and translate it into pig latin!

### Here's How It Works:
- Words that start with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) simply have "ay" appended to the end of the word.
- Words that start with a consonant have all consonant letters up to the first vowel moved to the end of the word (as opposed to just the first consonant letter), and "-ay" is appended.
